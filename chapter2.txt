git init
git add file-name or use . (dot) for all files // the reason to have this add propaties is very simple actually. 
We just not want to commit all the files every time. 
git status (Telling to me what is in repository and what is not)
ls a- (show secret files {did u know? ./ and ../ these are files!})
git commit -m "Yama notu (zorunlu)"
git log (tüm yamaları gösteriyor)
git diff file-name (that propaties telling me what's the different between the last version and not commited file)
