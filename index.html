       <h2> Just Write||</h2><p>
In this part ı just want to talk about my language level. I never go to any course. Actually ı can't even say anything with english a fev years ago.
And immadiatly ı decited to watch movies and series without subtitles. After that, in a little bit time ı become able to understand main topic.
But the speaking and writing part ummph, can be poor. Cause ı don't give so much
time to write and ı don't have any foreign friend. Ussualy ı'm reading and listening. Cause all the docs in the programming are in english and the course ı follow is english.
İf ı see a word accept my knowlage ı'm just checking it. Trying to learn. I'm sure, ı have a lot of mistakes in this pharagraph. I don't use any translate or something.
I'm merely a passive learner. With a little hardwork ı believe ı can be better. So, language not a big deal to learn in my opinion. Thanks a lot. <br> Anddd I did this simple page  :)
